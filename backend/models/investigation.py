"""A4's evidence investigation — the structured answer to "why do we believe
this finding is real".

Distinct from `RootCauseBrief` (`models/root_cause.py`), which is A4's *claim*:
a summary, a root cause and the citations backing it. This model is the
*audit* of that claim — every upstream source A4 could consult, whether it had
anything to say, and whether what it said supports or contradicts the claim.

Three rules govern every field here, and the tests enforce them:

1. **Unmeasured is `None`, never a default.** A severity nobody assigned, a
   confidence with no evidence behind it and a reproduction that never ran are
   all absent values. `0.0` and `"LOW"` are measurements, and writing one where
   nothing was measured is the failure mode the whole workspace exists to
   prevent.
2. **Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.** A scanner that could not
   run contributes an `unavailable` item, not a `contradicting` one. A3.5's
   full-suite gate does not target a specific A3 finding
   (`orchestrator/nodes.py::reproduction_gate` never reads `static_report`), so
   a suite that passed never contradicts a static finding.
3. **Every stance is earned.** `supporting` and `contradicting` are only set
   where A4 has a concrete reason; everything else is `neutral`.
