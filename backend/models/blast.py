#: Both traversal directions in `blast_traversal.py` resolve a raw import
#: string (e.g. `"app.auth"`) against SIG file paths — there is no import
#: resolver, only string matching. `resolved_suffix` is the precise branch
#: (`path.endswith(f"{module}.py")` / `stem.endswith(imp)`): the import string
#: names the end of a real file path, which is unambiguous for any
#: non-relative import. `name_contains` is the loose branch (plain
#: containment): `import os` naming `services/oslo.py` is exactly the false
#: edge this label exists to flag. Neither branch is "verified" against a real
#: import resolver — that distinction does not exist in this codebase, and
#: pretending backward edges are more trustworthy than forward ones would be
#: fabricating a precision the traversal does not have.
