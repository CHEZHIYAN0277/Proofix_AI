"""Trust gates applied before PR routing.

**This module is the only writer of `force_draft_pr`.**

It used to be three: A3.5 set it when reproduction failed, A4 set it when
citations stayed unverified, and this module set it for exhausted validation.
Answering "why is this a draft?" meant reading three files and knowing which
ran, and nothing guaranteed they agreed — a flag written from three places has
no single moment at which it is true.

Both agent writes were derivable from state those agents already published:
A3.5's from `reproduction.status`, A4's from `root_cause.evidence_incomplete`.
So the flag is now *computed* from that evidence, once, immediately before
routing. The agents record what they observed; this module decides what it
means. That split is the same one the rest of the pipeline follows — agents
produce evidence, gates make decisions — and it makes the reasons enumerable,
which is what puts them on screen.
