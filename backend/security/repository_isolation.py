"""Confine every run to a workspace it cannot escape.

The pipeline already clones into a temp directory. That is containment by
convention: nothing stops a path derived from a traceback, a citation, or an LLM
response from resolving outside it. This module makes containment checkable, and
gives every caller one function to ask "may I read this?".

Four escapes are closed:

**Absolute paths.** `/etc/passwd` arriving as a "file to read" resolves outside
the workspace and is refused.

**Traversal.** `../../secrets.env` is refused *after* normalization, not before —
checking the literal string for `..` misses `a/b/../../../etc` and rejects the
legitimate `a/../b`.

**Symlinks.** A link inside the workspace pointing out of it is the subtle one:
the path is inside, the target is not. Resolution follows links, so the check is
on the real path.

**Host disclosure.** Absolute workspace paths leak the operating system, the
user account and the deployment layout. `relativize` converts them back to
repo-relative form for anything heading toward a prompt.

Read-only enforcement is advisory rather than kernel-level: the pipeline must
write to the clone (A7 patches files), so the guarantee offered is *containment*,
not immutability. That distinction is stated here rather than implied — a
`chmod -R a-w` would break the repair, and claiming read-only while permitting
writes would be worse than claiming nothing.
