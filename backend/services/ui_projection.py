#

# surface had no cards for A0.5 and A5.5, so publishing them would have added
# cards that never rendered. A0.5 gained one in Phase 2 and A5.5 in Phase 4, and
# with that the distinction is gone: every agent the graph executes has a card.

# response, and `_V2_ONLY` is deleted rather than left as an empty category
# waiting to be repopulated. A registry test asserts the two surfaces stay

    A9 answers one question — did the patch introduce a finding that was not
    in A3's pre-patch baseline — and this projection carries the *comparison*
    that produced the answer, not just its result. `reconciliation` is one
    lane per known scanner; within a lane, each `(tool, file, message)` key
    lists its baseline and post occurrences and the `rails` pairing them, with
    the line delta each carried finding moved by. A post occurrence in no rail
    is introduced. That is the whole algorithm, addressable.

    It still does not compare severity: `_run_bandit`/`_run_semgrep` assign
    every finding the same constant 0.7, never a real per-issue measurement,
    so `severity` is omitted from `newFindings` and from every occurrence
    rather than displayed as something it is not.

    `reconciliationAvailable` is false for a run completed before A9 recorded
    the reconciliation (`SecurityRescanResult.reconciliation` defaults empty).
    An empty ledger for such a run would read as "nothing carried", which is a
    claim about the comparison rather than an absence of one — so the flag
    exists and the panel must say the detail was not recorded instead of
    rendering zeroes.

    `verdict` mirrors the three states the backend can actually produce:
    `security_score is None` means no scanner executed this rescan (not
    "clean" — "not measured"); otherwise `rejected` says whether a new
    finding was found. There is no fourth state.

    Returns `None` before A9 has run. A run that completed and found nothing
    new still returns a payload (`securityScore` real, `newFindings` empty) —
    "ran clean" and "never ran" are different facts.
