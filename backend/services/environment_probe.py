"""Can this repository's tests actually run here?

Deterministic, no LLM call, no network. See `docs/ENVIRONMENT_PRECHECK_DESIGN.md`
for the reasoning; the short version:

A manifest tells you what a project *declares*, not whether the environment can
*run* it. Every GitHub repository that fails today has a perfectly good
`pyproject.toml` — what it lacks is an installed `pytest`. So detection answers
"what kind of project is this", and the probe answers the operative question:
"will the test runner start".

**This module never installs anything.** `suggested_command` is a string for a
human to run. Installing dependencies from an arbitrary cloned repository
executes that repository's build hooks on the host, and the pipeline's
subprocesses are not yet sandboxed.
