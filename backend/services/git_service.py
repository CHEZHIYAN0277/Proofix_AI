    Every run copied an entire repository into a temp directory and left it
    there, so disk grew without bound with run count × repository size (B-B14).

    Deleting directories from a background job earns paranoia, so this refuses
    unless the path is inside the system temp directory *and* its own name
    carries `CLONE_PREFIX`. The case that matters is a misconfigured
    `repo_clone_path` pointing at a real checkout: that lives outside the temp
    root and is left alone regardless of what it is called.

    What this deliberately does *not* claim is that the directory was created by
    this process. A `sentinel_`-prefixed directory sitting in the system temp
    root is indistinguishable from one of ours, and treating it as ours is the
    right trade: a registry of paths we created would be process-scoped, so it
    would silently stop cleaning up after a restart — which is exactly when the
    leak matters most.

    Never raises: a run that finished must not be reported as failed because its
    temp directory could not be removed.
