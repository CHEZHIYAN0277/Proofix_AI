"""Detect what kind of repository this actually is, before indexing it.

A single-package library, a monorepo of twenty services, and a repository with a
vendored checkout inside it all need different treatment, and getting it wrong is
not a cosmetic problem:

* A **nested repository** — a directory with its own `.git` — has its own
  history, its own owners and its own churn. Indexing it as part of the parent
  attributes another project's commits to this one, which corrupts ownership and
  every risk score derived from it. Nested repositories are therefore detected
  and excluded, and reported so the exclusion is visible rather than silent.

* A **monorepo** has several independent packages that happen to share a
  checkout. Their source roots are separate, and a file in one is not a
  dependency of a file in another merely because they are adjacent.

* **Other languages** are represented as file nodes without symbols. The AST
  layer is Python-only and honestly says so, but a repository that is 60% Go
  should not report 40% coverage as though the rest did not exist — the files
  are real, they are owned, they have history, and the graph can carry all of
  that without pretending to parse them.

Detection is filesystem-only: manifests, directory markers, and file suffixes.
