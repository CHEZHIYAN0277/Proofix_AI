"""Assemble the minimal repair context A7 consumes.

Takes ranked files, extracts the code each contributes, masks secrets, enforces a
character budget, and renders the focused block. The budget degrades in a fixed
order so the target function and the acceptance criteria are never the thing that
gets dropped.

The builder refuses to make things worse. `extract_relevant_code` — the path A5.5
replaces — is already minimal when it resolves a target function: imports plus
that one function. A5.5 cannot undercut it there, because its core additionally
carries per-file scaffolding and the module constants the target reads. So the
package declares, via `prefer_focused`, whether A7 should actually use it: only
when it is smaller than that baseline, or when it masked a secret the baseline
would have sent in clear. Otherwise A7 keeps its existing path and the metrics
report a reduction of zero rather than an invented saving.
