"""Parse real mutation-testing output into evidence-backed counts.

Replaces the previous hardcoded `0.5` mutation score. A merge decision may only
consume numbers that were actually measured, so this module has exactly two
possible answers: a score derived from parsed mutant statuses, or an explicit
``unavailable`` outcome carrying the reason it could not be determined. There is
no third "assume something reasonable" path.

Supported mutmut output shapes, in preference order:

1. **Per-mutant listing** (mutmut 3.x ``mutmut results``) — lines of the form
   ``    <mutant_key>: <status>``. Most precise: every mutant is accounted for
   individually.
2. **Progress summary** (mutmut 3.x ``mutmut run``) — the emoji status line
   ``12/20  🎉 8 🫥 0  ⏰ 0  🤔 0  🙁 2  🔇 0  🧙 0``.
3. **Section headers** (mutmut 2.x ``mutmut results``) — ``Survived 🙁 (2)``.

Status classification follows mutmut's own ``status_by_exit_code`` vocabulary.
