#: The interpreter every Python subprocess runs under.
#:
#: Was the bare string `"python"` at seven call sites — the probe, A3.5, the
#: three in scoped validation and the two mutmut calls. That resolves through
#: `PATH`, which is whatever the server process inherited and is *not* the
#: interpreter ProoFix itself is running under. On a machine where ProoFix runs
#: from a virtualenv and `PATH` leads to a system Python, the probe reported
#: `No module named 'pytest'` while ProoFix's own interpreter had pytest
#: installed — and the message it printed claimed to be describing "the
#: interpreter ProoFix would run its tests with", which was the one thing it was
#: not.
#:
#: `sys.executable` is that interpreter, by definition. Using it also keeps the
#: probe and reproduction honest with each other: the probe's whole value is
#: answering the question A3.5 will later ask, and two different interpreters
#: are two different questions.
#:
#: The fallback exists because `sys.executable` is documented as possibly empty
#: when Python is embedded.
