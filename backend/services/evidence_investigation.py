"""Correlate A4's evidence into an auditable investigation report.

A4 already gathers evidence and produces a cited root-cause brief. What it did
not do until now is *show its work*: which upstream sources it consulted, what
each one actually said, and which of those statements argue for the finding
being real versus against it. This module answers exactly that, deterministically
and with no LLM involvement.

Everything here is derived from artifacts other agents genuinely persisted:

* **scanner** — `StaticAnalysisReport.scanner_status` (A3's own per-tool
  outcome) and the tool attribution on each ranked finding.
* **reproduction** — `ReproductionResult` (A3.5), including the command it ran
  and the exit code it got.
* **source** — A4's citations after `citation_verifier` has tried to anchor each
  one to real source, plus the stack-trace reference when there is one.
* **dependency** — A2's OSV advisories, but only those it classified as
  reachable against A1's import graph.

Two judgements are deliberately *not* made:

1. A3.5's gate is a full-suite run that does not target a specific A3 finding
   (`orchestrator/nodes.py::reproduction_gate` never passes `static_report`
   into it). A passing suite therefore does not contradict a static finding —
   it is recorded as neutral, with the reason stated on the item.
2. A source that could not run produces an `unavailable` item, never a
   `contradicting` one. No evidence is not evidence of absence.
