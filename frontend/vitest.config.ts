/**
 * Test config, deliberately separate from `vite.config.ts`.
 *
 * Two reasons it cannot just be a `test` block on the app config:
 *
 * 1. **The TanStack Start plugin must not run.** It applies its SSR/server-entry
 *    transform across the whole module graph, and under Vitest that resolves a
 *    second copy of React — every hook then reads a null dispatcher and the
 *    component suites fail before asserting anything. Tests render components
 *    directly and need no router runtime.
 * 2. **Vitest bundles its own Vite.** Sharing one `defineConfig` makes the two
 *    Vite type trees collide on the plugin array, so `tsc` fails on a config
 *    that runs perfectly well.
 *
 * The `@` alias is restated here because Vite 8's native `tsconfigPaths`
 * resolution is not picked up by Vitest's bundled Vite.
