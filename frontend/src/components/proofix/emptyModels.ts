/**
 * Neutral, empty view models for live mode.
 *
 * `useRunData` needs something to hold before the backend responds. Using the
 * bundled `MOCK_*` fixtures for that means a live workspace briefly renders
 * another repository's run — vulnapi's files, its trust scores, its verdict —
 * and any field the backend omits keeps showing fixture data indefinitely,
 * which is indistinguishable from real output. These blanks render as empty
 * rather than as someone else's data, so anything on screen in live mode came
 * from the backend.
