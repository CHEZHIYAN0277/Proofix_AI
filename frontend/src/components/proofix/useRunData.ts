/**
 * Fetches every view model for a run through the `runService` seam.
 *
 * In mock mode the service returns fixtures synchronously, so the workspace
 * renders identically with no backend running. In API mode the models are
 * polled while the run is live so header, summary and report stay current as
 * agents progress.
 *
 * Each model carries its own `{data, error, loading}` (B-F01, B-F08). The
 * previous version awaited a single `Promise.allSettled` and read only the
 * fulfilled results, so a rejected `/report` was indistinguishable from a run
 * that produced none: the panel rendered the empty model and said nothing. That
 * is the same defect class as the fabricated values already removed from this
 * codebase — the UI asserting a fact it does not have. A failed fetch is now a
 * reportable state with a retry, and one model failing never blanks the others.
