/**
 * Types for A6's repair plan endpoint
 * (`GET /api/runs/{runId}/repair-plan`, `services/ui_projection.py::build_repair_plan`).
 *
 * Distinct from `/api/runs/{runId}/plan`, which returns `state.fix_dag`
 * verbatim for API consumers that already depend on that exact shape. This is
 * the projected, joined view the workspace board reads: every step in order,
 * why it exists (joined against A3's findings / A2's CVE records — `FixNode`
 * itself carries no message), which steps it conflicts with over a shared
 * file, and A5.5's acceptance criteria / patch constraints carried forward as
 * *their* evidence, not recomputed or claimed as A6's own.
 *
 * **A6's plan is not what A7 executes.** `executionAuthority` states this
 * explicitly — A7 reads only `execution_order[0]` as a label and derives its
 * real patch targets from A5's blast scope and A4's root cause. Any UI built
 * on this data must keep that fact visible, not bury it.
 *
 * There is no confidence field anywhere in this contract, on purpose: nothing
 * in A6 computes one, and this UI must never invent it.
