 * Every field mirrors `InvestigationReport` (`models/investigation.py`)

 * supports the finding, which contradicts it, and how the confidence was
 * reached are all A4's judgements, made against real upstream artifacts.
 *
 * Fields the backend could not measure are `null`, never defaulted. In
 * particular `severity` is `null` for a reproduced runtime failure — no tool
 * assigns a severity to observed behaviour — and `confidence` is `null` when
 * there was no evidence to score, which is not the same as 0%.
